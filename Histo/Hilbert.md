# Hilbert

Hilbert fue tal vez uno de los mat mas destacados de su epoca, pero si
fue su "guia"

The history says about the time that Hilbert was seen day after day
in torn trousers, a source of embarrassment to many. The task of
tactfully informing Hilbert of the situation was delegated to his
assistant, Richard Courant.  Knowing the pleasure Hilbert took in
Strolls in the country side while talking maths,Courant invited him
for a walk.  Courant managed matters so that the pair walked through
some thorny bushes, at which point Courant informed Hilbert that he had
evidently torn his pants on one of the bushes, "Oh no", Hilbert
replied, "they've been that way for weeks, but nobody notices"

From the invention of the calculus (Leibniz and Newton) math have been
found a lot of spectacular applications of limit process. but by the
middle of the 19th century problems were arising that demanded
conceptual understanding that went beyond symbols.

the first big result Hilbert has obtained was "Hilbert's Basis
Theorem". (Gordan Prob)

But instead of furnishing a list of key invariants whose existence
Hilbert had established, this proof had merely shown that the
supposition of their nonexistence would lead to contradiction.
Hilbert's proof opened a windows on the math of the coming century.
Gordan responde was:*this is not math, is theology*. some months later
Hilbert fave Gordan a complete constructive proof.

Hilbert was very interested in the foundation of math Being a
geometrist Hilbert first focus on geometry. He gave a course where he
provided a set of axioms for geometry that plugged some  holes
in Euclid's classic treatment. He emphasized the abstract natural of the
subject: it must be shown by pure logic that the theorems follow from
the axioms without the corrupting influence of what we can "see" by
looking at the diagram. Hilbert provided a proof that his axioms are
consistent, that no contradiction can be derived from them.

In fact he reduce the consistency of Euclidean geometry to that of
arithmetic.

Hilbert published a set of problems that would lead the math
researchers all over the world.

The problem of the consistency of arithmetic was prob #2. In Hilbert's
new program, math and logic were to be developed together in a pure
formal symbolic language.
