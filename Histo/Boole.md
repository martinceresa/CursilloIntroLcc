# George Boole (1815 - 1864)

founder of the algebraic tradition in logic. In his first 6 career years Boole published
15 math papers.

In 1847 Boole presented his "Mathematical Analysis of Logic" giving an algebraic
approach to Aristotelian logic

Lets the symbols 1 represents the universe which "comprehends every conceivable class
of objects, whether existing or no". Capital letters X, Y, Z,etc denotes classes,
and introduce the symbol x corresponding to the class X, z to Z, etc...

then Boole introduce the first operation, the multiplication.
If the letters x and y stand for two particular classes, then Boole
wrote "xy" for the class of things that are both in x and in y.

Proposed the rule "xx = x".

In fact based his hole theory on that "xx = x" is always
true.

Q: In ordinary algebra, where x stand for a number, when is
the equation xx=x true?

A: x = 0 or x = 1.

This led Boole to the principle that the algebra
of logic was precisely what ordinary algebra would become
if it were restricted to the values 0 and 1.

However, to make sense of this, i became necessary to reinterpret the symbols
0 and 1 as classes.

0x = 0 and 1x=x.

Boole toke (x+y) to represent the class of all things to be
found either in x or in y (nowadays called the union of x and y),
(x-y) for the class of things in x that are not in y.

In practice:
xx=x => x - xx = 0 => x (1-x) = 0

Something cannot be and not be at the same time.
