# Cantor (1845 - 1928)

The natural numbers are infinite.

However, Aristotle was not willing to accept as legitimate
the culmination of this process- the infinite set of all natural numbers.

George Cantor who accepted the challenge to create a profund
and coherent math theory of the actual infinite.

Leibniz held that if such things as infinite numbers did exist, then the same
idea should apply to them: if one-one matching
can be found between two infinite set, then one should be able to
conclude that the two sets have the same number of members.

1 <-> 2
2 <-> 4
3 <-> 6
....

But one of the most basic math principles, going back to Euclid, is that the whole is greater than any
of its parts! Cantor and Leibniz faced the same dilemma, either it makes
no sense to speak of the numbner of elements
in an infinite set or some infinite sets
will have the same number of elements as one of its subsets. while Leibniz
had chosen the first, Cantor chose the second.

Cantor adem√°s se dio cuenta que los reales eran aun mas

#(Nat) = Aleph0
#(Reales) = Aleph1

En la prueba de que hay mas reales que nats ideo un metodo
utilizado en los siguientes grandes "El metodo de la diagonal"
