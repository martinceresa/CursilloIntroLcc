# Frege (1848 - 1925)

Frege era Nazi!! se metió justamente donde Boole se quedó corto

Frege sought a system of logic that included all of the
deductive inferences in math practice. Boole took ordinary
algebra as his starting point and used the symbols of
algebra to represent logical relations. Snce Frege
intended algebra, like other parts of math to be built as a 
superstructure with his logic as a foundation. Also, where
Boole ha thought of propositions that express relations
between other propositions a secondary props, Frege saw that
the same relations that connect propositions can also be used
to analyze the structure of individual props, and je made these relations
the basis of his logic. this crucial insight
has gained general acceptance and forms the basis of modern logic.

For example Frege would analyze the sentence
*All horses are mammals*
using the logical relationship *if ... , then ...*:
*if x is a horse, then x is a mammal*
And could be written as follows:
*(\forall x)(if x is a horse, then x is a mammal)*
The logical relation *if ..., then ....* is usually symbolized *=>*
*(\forall x)(x is a horse => x is a mammal)*
Finally, we can abbreviate as follows:
*(\forall x)(horse(x) => mammal(x))*

## Frege vs Russell
Frege wanted to provide a purely logical theory of the natural numbers
and thereby to demonstrate that arithmetic, and indeed all math could
be regarded as a branch of logic. Thus Frege wanted to be able to
defined the natural numbers as purely logical terms. The number 3 for
example. A natural number is a property of a set, namely, the number
of its elements.

# Russell's paradox as the barber version.
