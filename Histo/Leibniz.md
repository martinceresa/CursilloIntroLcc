# Gottifried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 - 1716)

Known as the last "universal genius". Metaphysics, epistemology, logic, philosophy of religion,
mathematics, physics, geology, jurisprudence, and history.

Leibniz was born in Leipzig on July 1, 1646, two years prior to the end of the 30 years war.

Father: Friedrich Leibniz: jurist and professor of moral philosophy,
at Univ. of Leipzig.
Mother: Catharina Schmuck, daughter of a professor of law.

Leibniz's father died in 1652, and his subsequent education was directed by
his mother, uncle, and himself.

1661 (15 years) -> University of Leipzig -> Univ of Altdorf.

He would seek a special alphabet whose elements represented not sound, but
concepts. A language based on such an alphabet should make it
possible to determine by symbolic calculation which senteces written in the lang
were true and what logical relationships existed 
among them.

Bachelor's degree at Leipzig: thesis about Aristotelian metaphysics: relationship between philo and law.
Bachelor's degree in law. systematic logic in Law.

For reasons that are not clear the Leipzig faculty refused
to accept the dissertation. So leibniz went to Univ. of Altdorf.
found a wealthy patron in Baron Johann von Baneburg.

In 1673 he was unanimously elected to the Royal Society of
London based on the model he was able to exhibit of a calc machine
capable of carrying out the four basic ops of arithmetic.
In 1674 he described a machine that could solve algebraic equations.

1675: he wrote comparing logical reasoning to a mechanism. Thus
pointing to the goal of reducing reasoning to a kind of
calculation and of ultimately building a machine capable
of carrying out such calculations.

Leibniz developed an entire calculus and developed an appropiate symbolism
(the one we use today) for the two central ops, integration and differentiation.

Newton also discovers the same calculus, therefore were rivals. But while
Newton's calculus was very complicate, Leibniz's one was a lot easier because
of the notation.

Young Leibniz Idea: It was clear to him that the special characters
used in arithmetic and algebra, the symbols used in chemistry and astronomy,
and the symbols he himself had introduced for the diff and integral calculus, all provided
a paradigm showing how crucial a truly appropriate symbolism could be.
Leibniz refereed to such a system of characters as a "characteristic". 
Unlike the alphabetic symbols which had no meaning, the examples
just mentioned were form him a real characteristic,
in which each symbol represented some definite idea in a natural
and appropriate way.

What Leibniz went after was, on the lines of serious "men of good will"
sitting around a table to solve some critical problem. After writing
out the problem in Leibniz's projected lang, his univ characteristic,
it would be time to say "Let us Calculate", out would come the pens
and a solution would be found whose correctness would necessarily be accepted
by Leibniz logic calculus.

For example:

Def. A is in L, or L contains A, is the same as to say that
L can be made to coincide with a plurality of terms
taken together of which A is one.

B (+) N = L  signifies that B is in L and that B and N together compose L

Axiom I : B (+) N = N (+) B
Axiom II: A (+) A = A
