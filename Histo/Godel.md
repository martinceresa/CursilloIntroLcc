In Gödel's doctoral dissetation, he succede in proving that first
order logic is complete.

Hilbert had reduced the consistency of euclidean geometry to the
arithmetic of real numbers, and Gödel proposed to carry the reduction
one step further, prove the consistency of arithmetic of just a nat
numbers. (Peanno arithmetic)

But Gödel not only failed in this endeavor, he proved the opposite, he
proved that he could not have succeded.

He effectevely buried Hilbert's program.

Gödel found that htere are props that viewed from outside such systems
could be seen to be true, yet could not be proved inside them, using
cant's diagonal method.

This conclusion applis yo a wide range of formal logic systems. For
any of these systems, there are true porps expressible in the system,
but not provable in the system.

In his proof Gödel had to deal with many of the same issues that those
designing programming languages and those writing programs in those
languages would be facing.

He actually made an itnerpreter or comp

After that, Gödel center into more philosophical questions. Gödel
raised the question fo whether the human mind was in all essentials
equivalent to a computer.  If the full power of the human mind can be
emulated bu a finite mechanical device, then Gödel's own
incompleteness theorem can be brought to bear to show that some
proposition about nat nubers, while true, can never be proved by human
beings, an absolutely undecidable proposition.

Death of starvation.
